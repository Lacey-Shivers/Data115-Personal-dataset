# Data115-Personal-dataset
Personal dataset project by Lacey Shivers

Motivation: 
The topic for my personal data is diabetes in women and different races.
A motivation for this project is the curiousity of diabetes overall, how it is affected in the population. I was led to this specific dataset provided by the Center for Disease Control (https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/data/index.htm) by the abundance of publicly available data. This source of data is related to the chronic disease of diabetes, I decided on the CDC data source because they use an open source of data that is large. The data is collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Population Health. The available data is updated this year of 2021, with the original dataset covering the years from 2010 to 2019 of diabetes in gender and different races of populations. The original data has data from all the states of populations affected. The data covers the CDC indicators for diabetes. I think this data will help potentially answer one of my questions. If the data can not answer one of my questions it can answer related questions of topic. The data is already processed into organized columns that covers data of years of chronic disease throughout the different states. Since it is open source and a large amount of data, I cut out all of the year start data before 2015 and the data containing the male gender to see a more recent trend of diabetes in women. The data will look at the diabetes and see how it is prevalent in people.

I plan on answering the questions 
 1) What is the average number of women who get diabetes in comparison to the different races of population? During the last 5 years.
 2) In 2019, did the average number increase or decrease for women and different races for people who got diabetes. 

Data Process: Using the most recently uploaded data to the github repository, 



Visualization:

Visualizations of Diabetes in Women and different races.

Contingemcy Table1 is between the different races and the year they were reported. 

Contingemcy Table2 is between the different races and number of cases per the amount of people in the different races reported.

The scatterplot shows a visualization of the data.
The plot represents the women and different races by the year they were reported, and colored by the number of cases reported. 
The plot helps visualize the relationship between the number of cases in the different races that were reported between the years 2015 to 2019.
